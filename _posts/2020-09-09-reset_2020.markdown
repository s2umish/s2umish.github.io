**Do what is right, not what is easy** .

I am about to refresh my mind by learning to CODE !!

I should have completed my computer engineering long back !!  Life is full of choices, and I get to make it again. I did what worked for me at that time , here right now, I am challenging myself to learn to code and design programs and use all the skills I have learnt in the past. I think the COVID era has shaken me up and I am ready to prove myself again.

I have managed projects , delivered programs , managed teams and have good experience in business management. I was missing the technical aspect of , developing and writing code. I think this program will fill the gap and help me relaunch into the world of Information Technology.

Writing and testing code is like solving puzzles, I find it stimulating , exciting and challenging. In this age of instant gratification, I find creating software, developing websites, working on programs , quite satisfying.
